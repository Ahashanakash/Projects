# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++




## Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed to demonstrate fundamental C++ programming skills. It is a basic project aimed at showcasing the use of core C++ concepts and standard library functions.
## Installation Instructions

To run this Tic-Tac-Toe game, you'll need a C++ compiler. The game is straightforward to set up:

- Copy the Code: Clone or download the source code from this repository.
- Compile and Run: Use any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) to compile the code. Then, run the compiled program.
```
g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe
```
## Usage Instructions
Once the game starts, the compiler will display instructions on how to play. The game is played between two players, each taking turns to place their mark ('x' or 'o') on the board. The game will guide the players through each step.
## Features

- Two-Player Mode: The game is designed for two players (player vs. player).
- Simple Interface: Instructions are provided on the console, making it easy to play without additional guidance.


## Technologies Used
- 2D Arrays: A 2D array to manage the game board.
- Functions: Modular approach with functions for moves, board printing, and checking game conditions.
- Control Structures: If-else, switch-case, and while loops are used to manage game logic and flow.
## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenges
- Determining the Winner: Implementing logic to check for a winning combination on the board.
- Valid Moves: Ensuring that players make valid moves within the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.
### Solutions
These challenges were addressed by implementing switch-case conditions for move validation and logical if-else conditions to check for winning combinations.
## Future Improvements
The following features are planned for future updates:

- Player vs. Computer Mode: Adding an AI opponent.
- Custom Board Size: Allowing players to choose different board dimensions.
- Game Difficulty Levels: Implementing different levels of AI difficulty.
